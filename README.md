# Romanumerator

The tool to use when you want to know the value of a string of roman numerals or
when you want to count the value of someone's name. It's useful for validating
claims made that the Latin title Vicarius Filii Dei has the value of 666. Most
mysteriously, the number of the beast could very well be the number of a man,
and that man would be them that sit in the golden throne of the roman church.
So, not only are there revelations of institutional child sex abuse and
extensive cover ups reaching high into the halls of power, but also the
scriptures seem to have it in for them too.
